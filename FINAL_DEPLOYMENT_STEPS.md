## Deploy Steps (Choose One):

### Option A: GitHub + Vercel Auto-Deploy (Recommended)

If your Vercel project is connected to GitHub, deployment will happen automatically:

1. **Merge to Main Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge homepage-search-fix
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Vercel Auto-Deploys**
   - Vercel will automatically detect the push
   - Build and deploy will start within seconds
   - Check Vercel Dashboard for deployment status

3. **Monitor Deployment**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Click on your project
   - Watch the deployment progress

### Option B: Vercel CLI Manual Deploy

1. **Login to Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```
   Follow the authentication prompts.

2. **Deploy to Production**
   ```bash
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Confirm Deployment**
   - Vercel will show you the deployment URL
   - Visit the URL to verify

## Post-Deployment Tasks:

### 1. Configure Environment Variables in Vercel

Go to: Vercel Dashboard â†’ Your Project â†’ Settings â†’ Environment Variables

**Add these variables:**

#### Public (No toggle needed):
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyBkDlxwkynkfrTNqrl6ijc0Ym6da-I4xl4
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=privacyhub-60bd3.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=privacyhub-60bd3
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=privacyhub-60bd3.firebasestorage.app
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=268505249664
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:268505249664:web:7c48c3aa67fb412269f365
```

#### Sensitive (Toggle "Sensitive" checkbox):
```
FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=privacyhub-60bd3
FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL=firebase-adminsdk-fbsvc@privacyhub-60bd3.iam.gserviceaccount.com
FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
OPENROUTER_API=<your_openrouter_api_key>
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=<your_firecrawl_api_key>
```

**Important:** Toggle the "Sensitive" checkbox for:
- `FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY`
- `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL`
- `OPENROUTER_API`
- `FIRECRAWL_API_KEY`

### 2. Deploy Firebase Rules & Indexes

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Deploy Firestore rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

# Deploy Firestore indexes
firebase deploy --only firestore:indexes
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

**Test Analysis Flow:**
1. Visit your deployed URL
2. Enter a privacy policy URL (e.g., https://google.com/privacy)
3. Submit and wait for analysis
4. Verify:
   - âœ… Analysis completes successfully
   - âœ… Logo displays correctly
   - âœ… Results saved to Firestore
   - âœ… Page shows last checked time with seconds

**Test Caching:**
1. Analyze the same URL again
2. Should return cached results instantly
3. Check for "Using cached analysis" message

**Test Rate Limiting:**
1. Make 6 analysis requests quickly
2. 6th request should show "Rate limit exceeded"
3. Wait 15 minutes and try again

**Verify Security Headers:**
```bash
curl -I https://your-domain.vercel.app
```

Look for:
- `Strict-Transport-Security`
- `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`
- `Content-Security-Policy`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`

### 4. Check Firebase Console

1. Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/privacyhub-60bd3/firestore
2. Verify:
   - âœ… Security rules are active
   - âœ… Indexes are deployed (4 total)
   - âœ… Analysis data is being saved
   - âœ… Domain-based documents exist

### 5. Monitor Performance

**Vercel Analytics:**
- Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Analytics
- Monitor:
  - Response times
  - Error rates
  - Traffic patterns

**Firebase Usage:**
- Go to Firebase Console â†’ Firestore â†’ Usage
- Monitor:
  - Read/write operations
  - Storage usage
  - Costs

---

## Rollback Plan (If Needed)

If something goes wrong:

### Quick Rollback via Vercel Dashboard:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard â†’ Deployments
2. Find the previous working deployment
3. Click "Promote to Production"

### Or via Git:
```bash
git revert 43f9fc8
git push origin homepage-search-fix
```

---

## Expected Performance Metrics

After deployment, you should see:

- **TTFB:** < 200ms
- **FCP:** < 1.5s
- **LCP:** < 2.5s
- **Build Size:** ~166 kB first load
- **API Response:** < 30s (analysis), < 100ms (history)
- **Cache Hit Rate:** > 80% (for repeated URLs)

---

## Monitoring & Alerts (Recommended)

### Add Sentry for Error Tracking:
```bash
npm install @sentry/nextjs
npx @sentry/wizard -i nextjs
```

### Enable Vercel Analytics:
Already configured! Just enable in Vercel Dashboard.

### Set Firebase Budget Alerts:
1. Go to Firebase Console â†’ Usage & Billing
2. Set up budget alerts for Firestore usage
