## Coding Standards

### TypeScript

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Define proper types/interfaces
- Avoid `any` type when possible
- Use type inference where appropriate

```typescript
// Good
interface AnalysisResult {
  score: number;
  grade: string;
  riskLevel: string;
}

// Bad
const result: any = { ... };
```

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop types

```typescript
// Good
interface ButtonProps {
  onClick: () => void;
  label: string;
  disabled?: boolean;
}

export function Button({ onClick, label, disabled = false }: ButtonProps) {
  return <button onClick={onClick} disabled={disabled}>{label}</button>;
}
```

### File Naming

- Components: `PascalCase.tsx` (e.g., `PrivacyAnalyzer.tsx`)
- Utilities: `kebab-case.ts` (e.g., `rate-limiter.ts`)
- Hooks: `use-kebab-case.ts` (e.g., `use-analysis.ts`)

### Code Style

- Use ESLint and Prettier (auto-formatted on save)
- 2 spaces for indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons at the end of statements
- Trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays

### Comments

- Write comments for complex logic
- Use JSDoc for functions and components
- Keep comments up-to-date with code changes

```typescript
/**
 * Validates and sanitizes a URL to prevent SSRF attacks
 * @param url - The URL to validate
 * @returns Validation result with sanitized URL
 */
export function validateUrl(url: string): ValidationResult {
  // Implementation
}
```
